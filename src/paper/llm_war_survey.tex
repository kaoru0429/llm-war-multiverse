\begin{abstract}
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the "First LLM Architecture War" spanning from the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 to the establishment of the Agentic Era in late 2025. We analyze the critical transition from Dense Transformer architectures to Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigms, driven by the economic constraints of scaling laws and the functional requirements of autonomous agents.
